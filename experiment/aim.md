**Introduction**

Creep is defined as the long term deformation of a member due to the sustained load. This takes place only when there is a load placed on a member at a single point for longer period of time. In the following experiment a member of certain material is taken for testing. Load is applied at point of member and for every minute extension is noted. 

**Objective**

To inspect the property of creep in metals (lead in this experiment).
