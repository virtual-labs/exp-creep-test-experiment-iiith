                "a": "Plastic deformation is the permanent distortion that occurs when a material is subjected to tensile, compressive, bending, or torsion stresses that exceed its yield strength and cause it to elongate, compress, buckle, bend, or twist.",
                "b": "Elastic deformation is a change of the shape of the body as a reaction to applied stress.",
